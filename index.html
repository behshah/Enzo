										<p> we corporate with the well-known carpet manufacturers either hand-made and machine-made.
											with the anti allergy raw materials which we use to fabricate our products we offer more than just a carpet.
											both natural and synthetic products we have are the best for allergy, asthma and eczema sufferers because it has 
											natural hypoallergenic properties, and absorbs common airborne contaminants, like cooking fumes, deodorants, 
											cleaning chemicals and smoke, which helps improve the air quality. they are also resistant to bacteria,
											 mould and mildew, and the lack of moisture in wool, due to the coil-like shape of its carpet fibres, also makes
											 it difficult for dust mites to survive.

									<h2 class="major">Silk</h2>
									<p>Our Persian & Oriental silk rugs are the most intricate, and often most valuable, of all hand-made rugs,
										The fine yet strong silk fibres used in these rugs allow more knots per square inch to be tied giving a clearer pattern with more detail and increased likeness to real-life.
										The most valuable silk rugs are 100% silk from the warp and weft to the pile. Because of their silk foundation there can be more warp strings 
										(visible as tassles or fringes at the ends of the rug) across with width - meaning more knots can be tied in a given area. With the more expensive materials coupled with finer knot counts comes more skilled artisans. 
										Our silk carpets come in a wide range of oriental silk carpets which made from highest quality of silk and unique in design, size and color appropriate for any type of decoration.

								<p>Wool is the fleece or the coat of sheep.AS a natural textile fiber it ages beautifully and provides a distinct look and feel.
									Because they are made from natural fibers, wool carpets are naturally flame-retardant and durable. They regulate temperature
									 much better than nylon carpets, which can feel damp and cold in humid climates. Wool carpets are a fantastic investment for
									  a home if you intend to stay there for a long time or have a heavily-trafficked area. It gives a feel of luxury to any room
									   and will make you feel like royalty every time you dig your toes into its plush material.
								   Because the material is stain-resistant, wool carpet tends to be easier to maintain than synthetic fibers. It also tends to be
									more colorfast (dyed in colors that will not fade or be washed out), with the wear of the carpet being more even. Many wool 
									carpet owners say it “ages gracefully.” Vacuuming and an occasional steam treatment should keep your wool carpet in great shape
									 for years.

									<p>Advancements in technology and manufacturing mean that synthetic carpets no longer take a back seat to wool. While wool has
										 natural stain and moisture resistance, many synthetic carpets are actually better in that regard because of improved
										  manufacturing processes. Synthetic nylon carpet can have as many long term benefits as wool carpet and in the right
										   environment they can be just as durable. Because of their affordability, nylon is often the preferred carpet fibre for
										    many homes.Modern carpets come in many different patterns, colors and shapes. Our large selection makes it easy to find 
											a carpet that’s perfect for your home. Our machine-made modern Persian carpets made in persia with high-quality syntactic 
											raw -material , giving a soft and beautiful carpet. Our Persian nomad carpets are available with modern inspiration and

		bamboo silk is a natural viscose. The cellulose gets extracted from the plant and it then gets formed into a sticky 
		paste. After the extraction process, the cellulose gets left to dry. After it is dried, it will then be expelled into
		 a soft and silky fiber. The end result is a fiber that feels similar to silk, with a feeling that is cool and soft to 
		 the touch. It is also very strong and comes with wonderful anti-microbial and hypoallergenic properties. When you have
		  bamboo carpets, you have the ability to place them in higher traffic areas and you never have to worry about them 
		  wearing down or matting. With the right level of care, your bamboo carpeting can last you upward of 50 years. 
		  Our bamboo silk carpets not only are these beautiful carpets to touch, but they come in a variety of patterns
		   and colors so that you can pick something that will fit in just right with your current decor and whatever budget
			that you have in mind.  </p>

										<p>Machine made rugs are produced by an electronically powered machine. Typically, the pattern is illustrated by computer, 
											or a punch card system to produce the design. There are large varieties of qualities in machine made rugs. 
											Avoid the ones made of synthetic fibers, and heat set or power-loomed construction. Machine made rugs made of wool and
											 manufactured in Persia are considered to be one of the best in this category, Note the strong visual differences between 
											 the machine-made and handmade rugs. In particular, the back of the machine-made rug is very different in appearance from
											  the back of the handmade rug. The design is not nearly as colorful on the back of the machine-made rug as it is on the face. </p>
